# Javascript, Modularity, and Webpack - A Wizeline Training Course
This is a beginner's frontend course on how javascript handles file structure, modules, and finally webpack. It is designed to take you from very simple development (cerca 1996-2001) to modern development using Webpack.

## Motivation
People assume that writing an application for a browser is easy. However, javascript *the language* was never designed for this, resulting in an ecosystem of tools that have been built to manage that part of the development stack. For example, javascript lacks:

- Encapsulation
- Modularity
- Strong data types
- Static analysis, because the actual code executing can change at runtime

Failure is easy, cheap, and common - by design. This makes enterprise application development hard. This course explains the history of this development, why tools like Webpack are needed, and how to use them.
